# react-native-router-flux-nav-bar
A cross platform NavBar component for `react-native-router-flux` (RNRF) that uses `ToolbarAndroid` on Android, a simplified version of the standard RNRF NavBar for iOS and `react-native-vector-icons` to display icons.

## Why?
I don't really like the default NavBar of RNRF, especially on Android. Since the NavBar has to be compatible and customizable, it has gotten quite complicated. It should instead be a simple component that uses the native ToolBarAndroid component by default and be designed according to guidelines such as those of Material UI and the iOS design guidelines. If you like customization, please use the default NavBar or create your own component.

## Usage
At the moment there is no documentation available. Please see the (Example) source code for more info.

## Future plans
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Add support for a tabbar / drawer
- [ ] Add a parallax view ([like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i__Hrjg3bEQ))
